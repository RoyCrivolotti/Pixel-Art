# Pixel-Art
A small project for a computer science course.

To use this, simply download the files and open index.html. Nothing more is needed, its pretty basic: download, open, draw!

Three things remain to be done: first, I want to make the grid more responsive, having the boxes in it of a set size, and being built dynamically regarding the window size (and rebuilt if the window size changes); secondly, implementing the drag functionality on the main grid to make it work on phones; thirdly, I tried using a the 'images-to-slices' library to grab an image from a file, drawing it using a canvas, then dividing the drawing into the amount of boxes in the grid and getting the predominant color in each little box to finally draw this in the main grid. However, while the first two items listed here are just a matter of having a bit of time, this last one I actually tried it and it gave me several problems. I'm sure there's a method to it, but to figure this one out I need more time.
